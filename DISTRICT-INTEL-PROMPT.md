## THE PROMPT (copy everything below this line)

---

I need you to build a complete district intelligence profile for **[DISTRICT NAME]** in **[STATE]** for the ModelIt K12 district sales system.

## Context

You are working in the `modelit-district-intel` GitHub repo (https://github.com/charlesmartinedd/modelit-district-intel). This repo contains a district sales intelligence system for ModelIt K12, an NSF SBIR-funded computational modeling platform for K-12 science and math education. The goal is to identify school districts where ModelIt can be sold by analyzing their budgets, STEM programs, curriculum, contacts, and board meeting spending.

ModelIt K12 is:
- An NSF SBIR Phase II funded computational modeling platform
- Lets students BUILD their own systems models (not just interact with pre-built simulations)
- Bilingual (English/Spanish)
- Aligns to NGSS Science & Engineering Practice 2 (Developing and Using Models) and Practice 5 (Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking)
- Complements existing curriculum (Discovery Education, Amplify, FOSS, etc.) - does NOT replace
- Includes teacher professional development
- Best fit for grades 5-12, especially where math/science proficiency is low

## What to Do

### Step 1: Research the District

Search the web for ALL of the following data points. Be thorough - use multiple sources to cross-verify. Key sources to check:

**Demographics & Academics:**
- District website (find it by searching "[DISTRICT NAME] official website")
- Ed-Data.org (for California districts): `https://www.ed-data.org/district/[COUNTY]/[DISTRICT-HYPHENATED]`
- Public School Review: `https://www.publicschoolreview.com/[STATE]/[DISTRICT-HYPHENATED]/school-district`
- CAASPP/EdSource (for California): `https://caaspp.edsource.org/sbac/[DISTRICT-NAME-HYPHENATED]-[CDS-CODE]`
- NCES (national): `https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/districtsearch/`
- Niche.com: `https://www.niche.com/k12/d/[DISTRICT-NAME-HYPHENATED]/`
- U.S. News: `https://www.usnews.com/education/k12/[STATE]/districts/[DISTRICT-NAME]`

**Collect these data points:**
- Enrollment (current year)
- Number of schools (elementary, middle, high breakdown)

### Step 3: Update the Comparison Spreadsheet

Open `comparison.xlsx` and add a new row for this district in ALL 8 sheets:
1. District Overview - demographics and metrics
2. STEM Budget - spending categories
3. Contacts - key personnel (top 5)
4. Board Approvals - leave empty (for future extraction)
5. Vendors & Partners - all identified vendors
6. Science Curriculum - by grade band
7. Entry Strategy - hook, funding, stage
8. Pipeline - current status and next action

### Step 4: Update the Pipeline

Add the district to `pipeline.md` in the Active Pipeline table.

### Step 5: Commit and Push

Stage all new and modified files, commit with a descriptive message, and push to the repo:

```
git add districts/[district-slug]/ comparison.xlsx pipeline.md
git commit -m "Add [DISTRICT NAME] district intelligence profile

- Full profile with demographics, test scores, STEM programs
- [X] contacts identified with verified emails
- Board meetings indexed (2025-present)
- Science curriculum mapped by grade band
- [X] vendors/partners with competitive analysis
- Entry strategy targeting [PRIMARY CONTACT NAME]
- Budget pathway: [PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE]

## Quality Standards

- **Every dollar amount and partner name must have a source** (URL or document name)
- **Only use verified emails** from district websites - do NOT guess email formats
- **Cross-reference test scores** with at least 2 sources
- **Mark unverified data as "TBD"** rather than making assumptions
- **Include "[NEEDS PDF REVIEW]"** for items requiring document download
- **Date every data point** - include "Source" and "Date Accessed" columns

## Important Notes

- This is for a UNITED STATES school district. Adapt the budget/funding analysis for the correct state:
  - **California**: Use LCAP framework, LCFF funding, CAASPP scores
  - **Texas**: Use TEA data, STAAR scores, strategic plans
  - **New York**: Use NYSED data, state assessments, budget documents
  - **Other states**: Find the equivalent accountability plan, state assessment, and funding structure
- For non-California districts, replace "LCAP" references with the state's equivalent planning document
- Always check if the district has a dedicated STEM coordinator or if science falls under a broader curriculum director
- The pitch should ALWAYS reference specific district data (test scores, program names, LCAP goals) - never be generic
